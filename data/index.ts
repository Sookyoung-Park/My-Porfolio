This ordeal typically involves extensive research to initially select three courses, only for most students to ultimately find themselves unable to secure a spot in these classes. This initial hurdle is followed by a frantic add-drop session, compounding the mental strain of the process. Furthermore, the existing interface for course registration is outdated and cluttered with information that many students deem irrelevant.In response to these challenges, this term, our DALI team undertook the task of designing a brand new course registration interface and overall experience for the Institute for Teaching and Learning at Dartmouth (ITC). Our primary objective was to transform this process into one that is not just efficient but also enjoyable and fulfilling. Our aspiration is to inspire students to embrace and appreciate the rich diversity of courses offered at Dartmouth, encouraging them to explore the array of opportunities available instead of succumbing to overwhelm in the rush to secure class placements.',

Due to the limitations of generating music with Jukebox for long audio files, I divided the music into four sections: intro, chorus, bridge, and outro, creating separate audio files of around one minute each. These files were then used as training input for Jukebox. However, every time I trained the model, the generated music had different styles. So, I went through multiple iterations and used Adobe Audition to edit the music and make it flow smoothly. I meticulously edited the music at the millisecond level to minimize any noticeable transitions and applied noise reduction techniques to remove noise from the generated music, giving it a vintage audio feel. Additionally, for automatically generated lyrics that were not understandable, I used Splitter AI to remove lyrics as much as possible from the music.

The gameplay mechanism involves using an analogue stick to move and navigate through the virtual environment, with the added ability to bounce from one surface to another, similar to how astronauts move on the moon, but with a lower gravity. The game\'s environment is set in a dreamy, infinite space populated with cell-like features, where some of the "grounds" could divide into smaller ones, simulating cell division and adding an element of fun and interest to the gameplay.  As players move through the environment, they will encounter various types of bacteria and viruses, each displaying unique actions such as injecting their arms or tentacles into the ground. The primary objective of the game is to neutralize these pathogens. The method of neutralization is yet to be determined, but could involve using a projectile or up-close interactions.'
